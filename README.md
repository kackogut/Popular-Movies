# Popular-Movies
Android app wchich I made from scratch as a part of Associate Android Developer Fast Track

## Features

Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:  
    * The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated  
    * Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional movie information  
    * Movies have to appear in Recycler View  
    * Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser), and allow read reviews of a selected movie.
    * Users can mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button (heart). This is for a local movies collection that will be maintained and does not require an API request.

Yet to come:
    * App would be optimized for tabled experience.

## Getting Started

App uses The Movie Database API. To connect to it you have to enter unique API key. You can create it here: https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup?language=en-EN , and then paste it to code marked with TODO.
